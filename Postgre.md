# LAB 6 WALKTROUGH POSTGRE THROUGH CONTAINER

# SETUP
## Remove the previous container

```sh
docker compose down -v
```
Additional commands if needed (can be skipped)
```shell
#remove containers
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

#remove volumes
docker volume prune -f

#remove all images
docker rmi $(docker images -q)

```
## Set docker-compose.yml

```sh
version: "3.8" 
 
name: lab-6-postgres 
 
services: 
  backend: 
    container_name: lab-6-backend 
    build: backend 
    environment: 
      - NODE_ENV=development 
    volumes: 
      - "./backend:/app" 
    env_file: 
      - ./env/postgres.env 
    links: 
      - db 
  db: 
    container_name: lab-6-db 
    image: postgres:15.4-alpine3.18 
    environment: 
      - POSTGRES_DB=development_db 
    env_file: 
      - ./env/postgres.env 
    volumes: 
      - pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data 
       
volumes: 
    pg_data: 
      external: false
```

## Create a file named postgres.env
Copy and paste the following setting:
```sh
POSTGRES_USER=postgres 
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password 
POSTGRES_HOST=db 
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```

## Change the configuration of \backend\connect_db.js file

To show all tables in the current database, run the following command in the MySQL shell:

```sh
/** 
 * Requiring this file will connect to the database and return the 
 * Sequelize database connection object. 
 */ 
 
const Sequelize = require('sequelize'); 
 
const dbConfig = { 
  host: process.env.POSTGRES_HOST, 
  port: process.env.POSTGRES_PORT, 
  // here we are selecting mysql as the database type we will be using 
  dialect: 'postgres' 
}; 
 
// Here we connect to the database 
const db = new Sequelize( 
  'development_db', 
  process.env.POSTGRES_USER, 
  process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD, 
  dbConfig); 
 
module.exports = db;
```

## Configure of /backend/package.json

```json
{ 
  "name": "backend", 
  "version": "0.0.1", 
  "private": true, 
  "dependencies": { 
    "postgres": "3.3.5", 
    "sequelize": "6.32.0" 
  } 
} 
```

## Configure /backend/Dockerfile

```json
# Base this image on an official Node.js long term support image. 
FROM node:18.16.0-alpine 
 
# Install some additional packages that we need. 
RUN apk add --no-cache tini curl bash sudo 
 
# Use Tini as the init process. Tini will take care of important system stuff 
# for us, like forwarding signals and reaping zombie processes. 
ENTRYPOINT ["/sbin/tini", "--"] 
 
# Create a working directory for our application. 
RUN mkdir -p /app 
WORKDIR /app 
 
# Install the project's NPM dependencies. 
COPY package.json /app/ 
RUN npm --silent install 
RUN npm install pg --save 
RUN mkdir /deps && mv node_modules /deps/node_modules 
 
# Set environment variables to point to the installed NPM modules. 
ENV NODE_PATH=/deps/node_modules \ 
    PATH=/deps/node_modules/.bin:$PATH 
 
# Copy our application files into the image. 
COPY . /app 
 
# Switch to a non-privileged user for running commands inside the container. 
RUN chown -R node:node /app /deps \ 
 && echo "node ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/90-node 
USER node 
 
# Run an interactive shell 
CMD [ "bash" ] 
```

# RUNNING THE CONTAINER
## IN THE ROOT FOLDER (lab-6)
Run:
```json
docker compose up --build
```
Your database is ready when you see this output

```
## Open New terminal
Run the following command:
```json
docker exec -it lab-6-db bash 
```

You will have a docker terminal similar to the output below:

```json
Lab06 % docker exec -it lab-6-db bash
c116a0ee5b3a:/# 
```

Inside the docker container, try to access PostgreSQL database. Run the following
```json
ab53eeeb5f63:/# 
PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -h $POSTGRES_HOST -d $POSTGRES_DB 
```
The overall output can be seen as follows:

```json
% docker exec -it lab-6-db bash
c116a0ee5b3a:/# PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -h $POSTGRES_HOST -d $POSTGRES_DB
psql (15.4)
Type "help" for help.

development_db=#
```
Now your PostgreSQL has been setup
# Populate data into database using Sequelize

## Open New Terminal
Under the backend folder, run the following command to run sequelize on JavaScript code:

```json
docker compose run --rm backend node populate_data1.js 
```

You may see the similar to the output below:
